# SoundIsland

SoundIsland is a small music streaming service with huge discography. Using this app you can find and listen to any song by It's name or artist(__Doesn't support song that has Cyrillic and French symbols in names__).   
From popular alternatives to my project you can be familiar with __Spotify__, __Apple Music__ or __Deezer__, but my app is completly free to use and download.
